# Pendulum Motion Analyzer

This project tracks and analyzes the motion of a physical pendulum using a BNO055 9-DOF IMU sensor and Arduino. Sensor data is sent to a Python-based system that computes angular velocity, kinetic energy, and damping behavior. The system also visualizes the motion and overlays real-time graphs of physical quantities.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Real-time sensor data acquisition using the BNO055 (via I2C)
- Python analysis pipeline with `matplotlib` and `numpy`
- Graphs of angular velocity and kinetic energy over time
- Curve fitting and damping coefficient extraction
- Future support for 3D visualization using `vpython`

## 🧪 Skills Demonstrated
- Signal processing with real sensor data
- Classical mechanics application (damped oscillations, energy)
- Arduino and Python integration
- Graphical data analysis and modeling
